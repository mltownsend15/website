Prescribing medications is both a science and an artâ€”designed to meet your unique needs.",

                    "During our appointments, we will take the time to explore your symptoms together. This may involve open conversations where you share your experiences or completing rating scales that help me understand what you're going through. By identifying groups of symptoms, we can categorize them into specific diagnoses that guide our approach.",
                    "Once we have a clearer picture of your mental health, we will work together to target those diagnoses with appropriate interventions. This may include prescribing medication tailored to your specific needs and providing counseling to support your overall well-being. Counseling is offered with medication management and not as a standalone service. Your first appointment will typically last one hour, allowing us ample time to discuss your situation in detail. Follow-up appointments will usually last between 30 minutes to an hour.",
                    "You have the flexibility to engage with these services in the way that suits you best. Some individuals may find that they only need support for a few months, while others might benefit from longer-term care spanning several years. The frequency of our meetings will also be based on your individual needs. We can meet as often as once a week or as infrequently as once every three months, which is the minimum requirement to ensure your care is kept up to date.",

The COE designation by the Health Care Authority indicates that the assessment is conducted by a professional with advanced training in autism. I continue to move my knowledge forward beyond the COE requirements to better understand the ongoing evolution of autistic spectrum disorder. I have been conducting COE assessments since 2018.",

This may include the use of psychology-level rating scales and observation tools to gather important information about your experiences and behaviors. Additionally, a functional/adaptive assessment may be conducted to understand how autism impacts daily activities and to align with the Developmental Disabilities Administration's requirements for service eligibility.",
                    "As part of the evaluation, there may be an interview with an informantâ€”such as a teacher, friend, or family memberâ€”who can provide valuable insights into your interactions and social functioning.

                    "Written recommendations will be provided to support you in school or work environments, along with a document that clearly communicates the presence of autism, if diagnosed. The sessions can last anywhere from 60 minutes to several hours, depending on the complexity of the information being assessed. Some people seeking services at Townsend Medical Services only need an autism assessment and not medication management.",
                    "What sets my COE evaluation apart is the emphasis on using psychology rating scales to help narrow down information from observations, leading to clearer conclusions. While autistic individuals share certain characteristics, each person is unique. This assessment aims not merely to assign a label, but to foster a deeper understanding of oneself and the ways in which autism manifests in a personal context.",
